Title: What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com and Press Enter?

Whatever happens when you type a URL into your browser and hit Enter? The journey from your keystroke to the webpage appearing on your screen involves a fascinating interplay of various technologies and processes. Let's delve into the intricacies step by step.

DNS Request:
The journey begins with a DNS (Domain Name System) request. When you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser, your computer sends a request to a DNS server to translate the human-readable domain name (www.google.com) into an IP address, which is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network. This IP address is essential for establishing a connection to the server hosting the website.

TCP/IP:
Once the DNS server returns the IP address for www.google.com, your browser initiates a TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) connection to the server. TCP/IP ensures reliable communication by breaking data into packets and routing them across the internet to their destination.

Firewall:
Before establishing a connection, the data packets pass through your local firewall, which acts as a barrier between your computer and potentially harmful traffic from the internet. The firewall examines the packets to ensure they meet certain security criteria before allowing them to proceed.

HTTPS/SSL:
In the case of "https://" URLs, the communication between your browser and the web server is encrypted using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) protocol, which is an extension of HTTP with added security features. This encryption is achieved through SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), which ensures that the data transmitted between your browser and the server remains confidential and secure from eavesdropping or tampering.

Load-Balancer:
Large websites like Google often use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal performance and reliability. When you request a webpage from Google, a load balancer routes your request to one of Google's many servers based on factors like server load and proximity.

Web Server:
Once your request reaches a Google server, a web server (such as Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS) processes the request. The web server retrieves the requested webpage and any associated resources (such as images, CSS files, or scripts) from storage and generates an HTML document to send back to your browser.

Application Server:
In addition to serving static content, many websites rely on application servers to handle dynamic content generation and complex business logic. For instance, Google may use application servers to process search queries or personalize search results based on your location and browsing history.

Database:
Behind the scenes, the application server may interact with a database to retrieve or store data relevant to your request. In Google's case, sophisticated databases power services like Google Search, Google Maps, and Gmail, enabling lightning-fast retrieval of information from vast amounts of stored data.

Conclusion:
The journey of a URL from your browser to the webpage involves a complex interplay of DNS resolution, TCP/IP communication, security protocols, load balancing, web servers, application servers, and databases. Each component plays a crucial role in ensuring a seamless and secure browsing experience, allowing you to access the vast wealth of information available on the internet with just a few clicks. Next time you type a URL into your browser, remember the intricate journey it takes to bring the webpage to your screen
